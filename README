Installer for Orchestra MVC CLI

Installation:
Open up terminal and run through these commands.

  Clone this Repository:

    1) $ git clone git://github.com/christopherhein/system-orchestra-mvc.git

  Go into the new directory:
    
    2) $ cd system-orchestra-mvc

  Run the Installer
    
    3) $ php install
    
If there are no problems with the install you should be able to run:

  $ orchestra new __project_name__;

To use instruments you need to pull them into your instruments folder, don't worry I made this really easy.
To do so you need to first find the instrument name from my GitHub account:
  
  https://github.com/christopherhein

For this example we'll use the twitter-addon.instrument
  
  https://github.com/christopherhein/twitter-addon.instrument
  
To pull instruments use:

  $ instrument pull twitter-addon

As long as there where no problems through out this installation you should now be able to use this instrument in your application.

Building your first app:

  Create Application
  
    1) $ orcheastra new twitter_app
    
  Enter the directory
  
    2) $ cd twitter_app/
    
  Install the Twitter Addon
  
    3) $ instrument install twitter-addon
    
  This will than prompt you with some instructions to complete the installation, follow these, and than run the app.
  
Other:
As far as this Framework goes it is version 0.0.1:beta so beware their may be bugs.

Thank you!
